# Dz-bot

## Description

expand past just soundboard, that I had previously developed for personal use.
Discord's soundboard feature made that context redundant. 

this bot aims to be need based on the communities and servers that I am responsible in. Feel free to contribute if you are in said communities, or see something that could be better. 

as always I am releasing this under the MIT license, so feel free to do whatever you want in your own context.
